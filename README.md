# Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB
Back-end of a restaurant application, called “conFusion”, built during the course from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on Coursera by Professor Jogesh K. Muppala.

Course from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on Coursera by Professor Jogesh K. Muppala. It explores the Node.js, Express and MongoDB, going through: 

1. Node, Node modules and the Node HTTP server. How to set up a REST API using Express; 
2. Data storage with MongoDB: mongoose;
3. User authentication;
4. Mongoose population;

As a hands-on course, throughout the modules, a back-end of a restaurant app, called “con Fusion”, is built to put concepts learned into practice.  

# Assignments 

## Assignment 1

>  In this assignment you will continue the exploration of Node modules, Express and the REST API. You will design two new express routers to support REST API end points for promotions and leadership.

## Assignment 2

> In this assignment, you will continue your journey with MongoDB and Mongoose. You will then create two new schemas for promotions and leadership, and then extend the Express REST API server to support the /promotions and the /leaders REST API end points.

## Assignment 3

> In this assignment you will continue the exploration of user authentication. We have already set up the REST API server to validate an ordinary user. Now, you will extend this to verify an Admin and grant appropriate privileges to an Admin. In addition you will allow only a registered user to update and delete his/her submitted comments. Neither another user, nor an Admin can edit these comments.

## Assignment 4
> In this assignment, you will be extending the router to support the ability to save and retrieve a list of favorite dishes by each of the registered users. All registered users in the system should have the ability to save any dish as their favorite dish, retrieve all their favorite dishes and remove one or all their favorite dishes.
